Sephora Syndrome Overview
Disease Name: Sephora Syndrome 
Classification: Neurogenetic Disorder 
Discovered by: Dr. Amara Delcroix in 2042 
Affected Species: Primarily humans, with rare cases in canines and felines.
Pathogenesis
*	Nerokytes: The primary cells affected by Sephora Syndrome, nerokytes are a unique 
type of neuron found only in the Sephoral lobe of the brain, a previously 
undiscovered region adjacent to the hypothalamus.
*	Xenofluorosis: A process where nerokytes undergo abnormal fluorization, leading to 
disrupted communication between brain regions. This process is believed to be 
triggered by the accumulation of Sephorin—a newly identified neurotoxin.
*	Sephorin: A novel neurotoxin that binds specifically to nerokytes, disrupting their 
normal function and leading to the symptoms of Sephora Syndrome. Sephorin is 
believed to be synthesized in the body following exposure to the rare mineral 
Sephorium, found only in the deep seabeds of the Mariana Trench.
Symptoms
*	Vorcian Hallucinations: A unique type of vivid, recurring hallucination where patients 
report seeing complex geometric shapes and patterns, often described as "vorcian 
spirals." These hallucinations are accompanied by intense feelings of nostalgia for 
places never visited.
*	Chronodystonia: A temporal disorientation where patients experience a distorted 
perception of time, either significantly slowing down or speeding up. This symptom is 
closely linked to the dysregulation of nerokytes.
*	Anokinetic Paralysis: A rare symptom where patients experience periods of complete 
paralysis, while remaining fully conscious. This is believed to be caused by the 
complete shutdown of motor nerokytes during episodes of Sephora Syndrome.
Stages of Sephora Syndrome
1.	Sephora Inception: Initial stage where Sephorin levels begin to rise. Patients may 
experience mild vorcian hallucinations and slight temporal disorientation. Nerokyte 
degradation is minimal.
2.	Sephoral Proliferation: Sephorin concentration increases rapidly, leading to more 
severe symptoms. Chronodystonia becomes more pronounced, and nerokytes show 
significant fluorization.
3.	Terminal Sephorosis: The final stage, marked by widespread nerokyte degradation 
and irreversible damage. Anokinetic paralysis is frequent, and patients often enter a 
comatose state.
Treatment and Management
*	Sephoralin: An experimental drug that targets Sephorin molecules, preventing them 
from binding to nerokytes. Early trials show promise in slowing the progression of 
Sephora Syndrome.
*	Chronostabilizers: A class of medications designed to stabilize the perception of time 
in patients with Chronodystonia. These drugs work by modulating the activity of 
surviving nerokytes.
*	Vorcalept Therapy: A form of cognitive therapy aimed at helping patients manage 
vorcian hallucinations. Patients are trained to recognize and "dismiss" the geometric 
patterns, reducing their emotional impact.
Epidemiology
*	Incidence Rate: Approximately 1 in 1,000,000 globally, with higher prevalence in 
individuals who have traveled to deep-sea environments or consumed seafood from 
the Mariana Trench.
*	Geographical Distribution: Cases have been reported primarily in coastal regions, 
particularly in areas with known Sephorium deposits.
Research and Future Directions
*	Nerokyte Regeneration: Scientists are investigating the potential for nerokyte 
regeneration using stem cell therapy, which could offer a cure for Sephora Syndrome.
*	Sephorin Inhibitors: Development of more effective Sephorin inhibitors is a key 
focus, aiming to prevent the onset of Sephoral Proliferation entirely.
Patient Case Study
*	Patient ID: S-2042-A
*	Age: 34
*	Occupation: Marine Biologist
*	Symptoms: Patient reports severe vorcian hallucinations and early-stage 
Chronodystonia. Sephoralin treatment has shown partial effectiveness, with a 40% 
reduction in Sephorin levels.
*	Prognosis: Patient is currently in the Sephoral Proliferation stage. Continued 
monitoring and treatment adjustments are recommended.
 
Too Faced Syndrome Overview
Disease Name: Too Faced Syndrome 
Classification: Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder 
Discovered by: Dr. Helena Mortensen in 2038 
Affected Species: Humans, with isolated cases in primates.
Pathogenesis
*	Duplicarocytes: The primary cells affected in Too Faced Syndrome, duplicarocytes are 
a type of neural cell that undergoes abnormal division, leading to dual personalities 
within a single brain structure.
*	Synaptic Dichotomy: A condition where duplicarocytes form two distinct neural 
pathways, each supporting a different personality or behavioral pattern. This 
dichotomy is at the heart of the dual identity phenomenon seen in Too Faced 
Syndrome.
*	Psychomorphosis: A process where environmental factors, particularly intense social 
stress, trigger the formation of a secondary personality. Psychomorphosis is 
irreversible once initiated, leading to permanent personality bifurcation.
Symptoms
*	Bifacial Delusions: Patients experience vivid delusions where they believe they are 
two separate individuals, often with opposing moralities or objectives. This can lead 
to internal conflict and confusion.
*	Mirrormorph Episodes: A symptom where patients physically manifest behaviors, 
speech patterns, or even skills that belong to their "other self." These episodes are 
unpredictable and can last from minutes to hours.
*	Cognitive Dyssynchrony: A disruption in thought processes where the two 
personalities struggle for control, leading to erratic behaviors, decision-making 
difficulties, and memory blackouts.
Stages of Too Faced Syndrome
1.	Initial Bifurcation: The early stage where duplicarocytes begin forming, and patients 
experience mild cognitive dyssynchrony. Bifacial delusions are rare at this stage.
2.	Emerging Dichotomy: Dual personalities become more distinct, with patients 
alternating between them more frequently. Mirrormorph episodes become 
noticeable.
3.	Full Dichotomy: The final stage, characterized by a complete split in identity. The two 
personalities may become fully independent, and patients might lose awareness of 
their alternate self during episodes.
Treatment and Management
*	Synchrostabilizers: Medications designed to harmonize the activities of 
duplicarocytes, reducing cognitive dyssynchrony and mitigating the effects of 
psychomorphosis.
*	Psychomorph Suppressants: Experimental drugs aimed at preventing the onset of 
psychomorphosis. These are administered to patients at risk of developing Too Faced 
Syndrome due to high-stress environments.
*	Mirror Integration Therapy (MIT): A specialized therapy that focuses on integrating 
the two personalities into a single cohesive identity, helping patients regain control 
over their actions and thoughts.
Epidemiology
*	Incidence Rate: Approximately 1 in 500,000, particularly prevalent in individuals with 
high-stress occupations or a history of severe psychological trauma.
*	Geographical Distribution: Most cases are reported in urban environments where 
social pressures are intense.
Research and Future Directions
*	Duplicarocyte Modulation: Ongoing research aims to better understand the triggers 
for duplicarocyte division and develop treatments that can prevent or reverse this 
process.
*	Personality Integration Techniques: New therapeutic approaches are being explored 
to help patients with Full Dichotomy stage regain a unified sense of self.
 
MAC Disorder Overview
Disease Name: MAC Disorder (Memory Anomalous Cortex) 
Classification: Neurological Memory Degeneration 
Discovered by: Dr. Vincent Armand in 2045 
Affected Species: Humans.
Pathogenesis
*	Memorocytes: The specific neural cells involved in MAC Disorder, memorocytes are 
responsible for the storage and retrieval of long-term memories. In MAC Disorder, 
these cells undergo premature degeneration.
*	Neurofibrillary Tangles: Unique to MAC Disorder, these tangles form around 
memorocytes, disrupting their function and leading to memory loss. The formation 
of these tangles is accelerated by the presence of Macrolide proteins.
*	Macrolide Proteins: Abnormal proteins that aggregate in the brain, particularly 
within the Memory Anomalous Cortex (MAC). These proteins are toxic to 
memorocytes and are the primary cause of memory degradation in MAC Disorder.
Symptoms
*	Anteromorph Amnesia: A progressive loss of ability to form new memories, while 
older memories remain intact initially. This is often one of the first signs of MAC 
Disorder.
*	Retrogradual Fade: Gradual loss of older memories, starting with the most recent 
and moving backward in time. Patients often describe their memory loss as watching 
a photograph slowly fade away.
*	Cognitive Fragmentation: As memorocytes degrade, patients experience fragmented 
thoughts, confusion, and difficulty recalling even basic information. This symptom is 
common in the later stages of the disorder.
Stages of MAC Disorder
1.	Initial Memory Decay: Patients begin to experience mild anteromorph amnesia, with 
occasional episodes of cognitive fragmentation.
2.	Progressive Degeneration: Memory loss becomes more pronounced, with 
retrogradual fade affecting recent memories. Neurofibrillary tangles are widespread 
at this stage.
3.	Terminal Memory Collapse: Complete loss of memory, leading to a vegetative state. 
Patients at this stage require constant care and are often unable to recognize even 
close family members.
Treatment and Management
*	Macrolide Inhibitors: Drugs designed to prevent the aggregation of Macrolide 
proteins, slowing the progression of the disorder. These are currently in experimental 
stages.
*	Neuroregenerative Therapy: A treatment that involves the use of stem cells to 
regenerate damaged memorocytes. This therapy is still in its early stages but shows 
promise in clinical trials.
*	Memory Stabilization Exercises: Cognitive exercises aimed at strengthening 
remaining memories and slowing the onset of retrogradual fade. These exercises are 
often combined with medication for better outcomes.
Epidemiology
*	Incidence Rate: 1 in 200,000, with higher prevalence in older adults and those with a 
family history of neurodegenerative diseases.
*	Geographical Distribution: Cases are evenly distributed globally, with no significant

that gives skin its color. In Fenty Affliction, these cells become hyperactive due to 
autoimmune attacks.
*	Melanotoxins: Autoantibodies that target pigmentocytes, causing them to produce 
excessive melanin. This leads to hyperpigmentation and, in some cases, 
depigmentation.
*	Skin Dyschromia: A condition where patients develop irregular patches of dark and 
light skin, creating a mottled appearance. This is the hallmark of Fenty Affliction.
Symptoms
*	Hyperpigmentary Lesions: Dark patches of skin that appear primarily on the face, 
hands, and neck. These lesions are usually the first visible sign of Fenty Affliction.
*	Hypochromatic Spots: Areas of skin that lose pigment, resulting in white or light 
patches. These spots often contrast sharply with hyperpigmentary lesions.
*	Dermatotemporal Sensitivity: Increased sensitivity to sunlight and temperature 
changes, leading to discomfort and further pigmentation changes.
Stages of Fenty Affliction
1.	Initial Pigment Shift: Patients notice subtle changes in skin color, with small 
hyperpigmentary lesions forming. Skin dyschromia is minimal.
2.	Advanced Dyschromia: The skin becomes increasingly mottled, with large areas of 
hyperpigmentation and hypochromatic spots. Dermatotemporal sensitivity 
intensifies.
3.	Chronic Dyschromia: Irreversible skin changes occur, with the entire body affected. 
Patients may also develop secondary skin conditions due to chronic sensitivity.
Treatment and Management
